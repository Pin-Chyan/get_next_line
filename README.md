get_next_line is an individual project given by the 42 curriculum that bascially required us to make a C function that 
basically reads a file line by line, It may make use of the previous individual project of Libft.

The learning process of this was teaching us how to efficiently make use of read, malloc and free.
from one of C libraries called <stdlib.h>
